When my manager came up to me at the start of the year and said we were going to rewrite the backend for the Beauty Buddy app using Node.JS, my first reaction was "Eeep!" I had been hired on as a PHP developer after all. "Well", I thought to myself, "time to crack open some tutorials and get learning". And so I did. My evenings and weekends became learning this new way of structuring code, new ways of writing code to do what I wanted it to do and reading a boat load of documentation. 

And what did I get from this effort? A new favourite way to write code and the beginning of a new direction I wished to grow in a professional sense - exactly what I had not expected to happen.
